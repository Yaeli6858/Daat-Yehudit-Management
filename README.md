## UI Design

The entire application theme is defined in a single file: `client/src/MainDesign/theme.js`, using Material-UI's `createTheme`. This centralized approach makes it easy to update the look and feel of the whole app from one place.

**Color palette:** The design uses deep red (`#b71c1c`) as the primary brand color, with dark red (`#7f0000`) for hover states and headings, against a clean light gray background (`#f5f5f5`) and white cards.

**Typography:** All text uses the **Rubik** font (with Arial as fallback), which gives the interface a modern, rounded feel well-suited for Hebrew content. Headings are bold and centered in the brand red color.

**Custom component variants:**
- Buttons come in several variants: `addButton`, `miniButton`, `activeButton`, and `iconButton` — each tailored for a different action context
- Cards support `donorCard` and `linkCard` variants with hover animations (a smooth upward lift effect)
- Tables have styled headers with a soft red background (`#ffe6e6`) and centered text throughout
- Dialogs are rounded with a subtle shadow, sized at 25vw for a focused modal experience
- TextFields support a `descriptionField` variant with a scrollable, resizable textarea

**RTL-ready:** The font choice (Rubik) and centered layout patterns are well-suited for Hebrew right-to-left content across all pages.
